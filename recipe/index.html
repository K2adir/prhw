          <h3>Chicken:</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>2 pounds chicken tenders</li>
            <li>1 orange, zested and juiced</li>

          <h2>Directions</h2>

          <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <p>
            Muddle 4 blackberries in the bottom of a microwave-safe glass
            serving jar. Add chile powder and red pepper flakes, then maple
            syrup; stir syrup briskly until well combined.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 2</h3>
          <p>
            Place chicken in a large, shallow baking dish. Drizzle with orange
            juice and season liberally with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until
            needed. Whisk orange zest with coconut flour, almond flour, garlic,
            and paprika. Set dredging mixture aside.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 3</h3>
          <p>
            Mix gluten-free flour, baking powder, rosemary, thyme, and sea salt
            together in another bowl to start the waffle batter.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 4</h3>
          <p>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Preheat a waffle
            iron according to manufacturer's instructions and spray with cooking
            spray.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 5</h3>
          <p>
            Beat butter and maple syrup together in a bowl using an electric
            mixer until creamy. Add eggs 1 at a time. Gradually add the
            gluten-free flour mixture and milk in 3 alternating batches. Stir in
            Cheddar cheese just until combined. Pour batter into the preheated
            waffle iron. Cook until crisp and deeply brown, 6 to 8 minutes per
            waffle. Place waffles on a baking sheet and keep warm in the
            preheating oven while preparing chicken.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 6</h3>
          <p>
            Line another baking sheet with parchment paper. Gently shake excess
            orange juice off each chicken tender and press all sides into the
            reserved coconut flour mixture. Place coated chicken on the prepared
            baking sheet. Remove waffles from oven and keep warm.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 7</h3>
          <p>
            Bake chicken in the preheated oven, flipping halfway, until browned
            on both sides, about 20 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer
            inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74
            degrees C).
          </p>
          <h3>Step 8</h3>
          <p>
            Microwave syrup until warm, about 1 minute. Top each waffle with a
            warm chicken tender or two and a handful of blackberries. Drizzle
            with the warmed spicy maple syrup.
          </p>
